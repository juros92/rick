  <p><em>Rick from world <strong>C-137</strong></em></p>
  <p>Richard <strong>"Rick"</strong> Sanchez is one of the two eponymous protagonists from the Adult Swim animated television series Rick and Morty. Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, Sanchez is a misanthropic alcoholic scientist inspired by
    Emmett "Doc" Brown from Back to the Future and Mister Fantastic from Marvel Comics. Known for his reckless, nihilistic behavior and pessimistic personality, the character has been well received. He is a sociopathic mad scientist who seems to know
    everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. However, despite assuming himself to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times when he has been wrong.</p>
